# Brainfuck interpreter in Golang
A brainfuck interpreter written in golang. Currently all basic features work.
The source code file is interpreted by using the -f flag and the -v flag provides
verbose output. Brackets are always checked for errors.

New features include:
- Verbose output
- Benchmarking
- Better error handling

Future features will include, in order:
- Better debugger
- Multi-file input

The program will be considered 1.0 status when all basic features are working
and verified reasonably free of bugs.
