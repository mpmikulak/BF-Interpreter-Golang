# Brainfuck interpreter in Golang
A brainfuck interpreter written in golang. Currently all basic features work except adding user input and the only argument the 
executable accepts is the path of the source code. The program allways checks for missing and mismatched brackets.

Future features will include:
- Verbose mode
- Muliti-file input
- Better debugger

The program will reach 1.0 status when all basic features are working and verified reasonably free of bugs.
